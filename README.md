# California Housing Price Prediction with MLPRegressor

## Project Overview
This project trains a model to predict median house values using the California Housing dataset. MLPRegressor is trained with early stopping and custom hyperparameters, and the result of the model’s performance showing the Actual vs. Predicted plots are saved for both the training and test datasets inside the figures folder.

## How to run the code
### pip install -r requirements.txt
### python model.py
